        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <!-- It allows us to decide how to solve the problem of version control rather than be told by giving us the tools.
        We are primarily problem solvers, after all, and are best suited to decide what works best in our individual situations. 
        Where subversion dictated your version control workflow even if it didn't fit with your particualr situation, 
        git gives you the tools you need and allows you to combine them in any way. Think grep, awk, and sed and how awesome they
        are any time you need to do a little something something on *nix.
        -->
        <h4>Some reasons why we choose/migrated to git</h4>             
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages to individual developer workflows.</li> 
            <!-- 
            * Crafting commits that represent logical ideas and units of work rather than a physical movement of time.
            * Dubstep and Basedrop
            -->
            <li>Advantages to team workflows.</li>
            <!--
            * Awesome for distributed teams working togeather, topic/feature/wip branches.
            -->
            <li>Flexibility in workflow. Branches are very seamless.</li>
            <li>Faster and less error prone than subversion is, no more are files locked, unable to be cleaned or updated.</li>
            <li>The OSS tools we use all use git and workflows for submitting patches have moved to pull requests.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <!-- I've been using Git since not long after I first started working at PQA. I got tied of files being constantly locked
        and not able to be cleaned up. It was difficult to craft logical commits when you had just completed a large chuck of work.
        I also noticed that the OSS that we used were all moving into git repositories and there was the rise of Github.
        Git was cool and it had a tool to work with subversion repositories so I switched. I added one extra step to my workflow
        'push' and lived happily like that for a while. I slowlly added on more and more understanding, then when WCI/CA project
        choose git from the start and the AU project switched I got trust in to the teacher role. I've learned so much since
        then thanks to everyone awesome questions.

        There are really two things that I hope we walk away with today. I hope that if I succeed that you will have the tools
        to reason and answer your own question that we might not have directly covered.

            <h3>Mental Model</h3>
            <p>Develop a mental model of the git repository, local vs remote, working directory vs stage vs index.</p>
            <!-- Be able to imagine the git repository and how it is structured. -->

            <li class="slide fade">
            <h3>Visualize Commands</h3>
            <p>Once we have a mental model we can examine how common git commands affect the model.</p>
            <!-- See how command affect that model and understand how to craft them togeather into meaningful workflows. -->

        <p>A set of object where some of the objects are connected by links. Real world you can think of Social Networks as graphs. Each person is a node and the relationship between

        <!-- Our graph happens to be a set of "Commits" where each commit represents a series of changes, and
        the links or edges are the relationship between those changes.Facebook is a great example of this.
        There are even databases that rather than being relational are graph. -->

        well. This is really important to understand as we start thinking about merges, rebases, and history.
