            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- It allows us to decide how to solve the problem of version control rather than be told by giving us the tools.
            We are primarily problem solvers, after all, and are best suited to decide what works best in our individual situations.
            Where subversion dictated your version control workflow even if it didn't fit with your particualr situation,
            git gives you the tools you need and allows you to combine them in any way. Think grep, awk, and sed and how awesome they
            are any time you need to do a little something something on *nix.
            -->
            <h4>Some reasons why we choose/migrated to git</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Advantages to individual developer workflows.</li>
                <!--
                * Crafting commits that represent logical ideas and units of work rather than a physical movement of time.
                * Dubstep and Basedrop
                -->
                <li>Advantages to team workflows.</li>
                <!--
                * Awesome for distributed teams working togeather, topic/feature/wip branches.
                -->
                <li>Flexibility in workflow. Branches are very seamless.</li>
                <li>Faster and less error prone than subversion is, no more are files locked, unable to be cleaned or
                    updated.
                </li>
                <li>The OSS tools we use all use git and workflows for submitting patches have moved to pull requests.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <!-- I've been using Git since not long after I first started working at PQA. I got tied of files being constantly locked
            and not able to be cleaned up. It was difficult to craft logical commits when you had just completed a large chuck of work.
            I also noticed that the OSS that we used were all moving into git repositories and there was the rise of Github.
            Git was cool and it had a tool to work with subversion repositories so I switched. I added one extra step to my workflow
            'push' and lived happily like that for a while. I slowlly added on more and more understanding, then when WCI/CA project
            choose git from the start and the AU project switched I got trust in to the teacher role. I've learned so much since
            then thanks to everyone awesome questions.

            There are really two things that I hope we walk away with today. I hope that if I succeed that you will have the tools
            to reason and answer your own question that we might not have directly covered.

            <!-- Ask the question: If you were to create a tool that allowed to to choose only part of the files that have been changed
and group them togeather to be commited. How might you do that? -->
            <p>Git is all over the place in what it calls this thing. The most consistent way to think about it is as
            staging things to be committed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git diff --cached</code> Does a diff of what is staged to be committed vs the HEAD. The
                                                   documentation tells me that <strong>cached</strong> is a synonym of
                                                   staged.
                </li>
                <li><strong>index</strong> refers to the stage itself</li>
                <li>using <code>git add</code> to <strong>update</strong> a file</li>
                <li>etc... Inconsistencies in documentation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When talking to others refer to it as the stage or staging area, and staging to be committed.</p>

            <p>This is a new feature compared to subversion. The subversion commit was all changes whereas git commit is
               just staged changes.</p>
            <!-- Talk about the power of this. Talk about how you can even stage just individual parts of files. -->

                           man page for merge has pretty decent descriptions of what situations they are useful for. For
                           example <code>--strategy=recursive --strategy-option=patience</code> is useful when merging
                           two branches that have diverged significantly.</p>
